# Horiseon 

## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn refactoring in HTML and CSS, and the reason I built this project is to better understand Semantic HTML and understand the structure of CSS. I cleaned the code up adding Semantic code, I learned doing so the code is clean easy to look at and also easier for the next developer to understand what was done before them.
